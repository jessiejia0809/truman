# Basic simulation components

Before you begin defining the simulation content (such as actors, posts, comments, notifications), you may want to change other components of the simulation.

Below are some simulation components that can be changed via the environment variables `.env` file. These include the site name and logo, the number and names of the experimental conditions on your site, and feed order. See the table below for a list and description of these components.

| Environment Variable         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

Remember to append **?r_id=** to the end of your survey link and set `POST_SURVEY_WITH_QUALTRICS` to `TRUE`. If no, remove this variable from the `.env` file by removing the line from the file.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

Participants are randomly assigned to an experimental condition upon account creation. This variable defines the labels (names) of these experimental conditions. The names as they appear here are also how they appear in the database.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

### How to change these components

These components can be changed in the `.env` file found in the project folder. It looks like the following when opened with a text file editor:

![](env-file.avif)

To change or define a variable, replace the value after the equals sign of the corresponding variable with your desired value.

- For example:
  - If you would like to change the site name to “FootballForums”, then you will need to change the line:
    - `SITE_NAME=eatsnap.love` to `SITE_NAME=FootballForums`

> [!NOTE]
> When changing variable names, there should be no spaces between the variable name, equals sign, and variable value. The following **will not work** because of spacing between the equals sign**.**
>
> - `SITE_NAME= FootballForums`
> - `SITE_NAME = FootballForums`
>
> If your variable _value_ has a space, enclose the value with quotes. For example:
>
> `SITE_NAME="Football Forums"`

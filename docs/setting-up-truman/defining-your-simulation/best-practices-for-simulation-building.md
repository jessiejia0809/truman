## Best Practices for Simulation Building

- Create the actors and agents first.
  - Be creative but not TOO creative. Aim for believability.
  - Remember who your target audience and participants will be.
  - Be consistent!
  - Use profile images that are not easily found on Google Images.
  - Don’t be too perfect! Most people don’t fill everything out completely.
- Then, create posts for your actors.
  - Use (or get) your own images that look “real” and not easily found online.
  - Be consistent! Two bots can’t have the same kitchen if you haven’t stated somewhere that they live together, etc.
  - Be fun and create a story for your bot. What is their day like? What do they post? What do they like?
  - Spread out the timing of posts and follow the same rules you listed for participants (remember these bots should look and act like other participants in the study).
  - Create some spam/political infighting/internet drama/web trash as no site is perfect.
  - Think about “likes” the posts get, what is popular on the site, what is not.
- After creating posts, create comments on these posts.
  - Be quick and short.
  - Positive but not too positive.
  - Role play as your actor, do all your comments for one actor at a time, role-playing as that actor.
  - Have some small conversations between actors in the comments.
  - This is where we create “community”.
- Write together as a research team.
  - If you are creating and writing a simulation collaboratively, upload the CSV files to Google Docs or Box. Makes it much easier to edit together.
- Test test test!
  - Live in your simulation and experience what feels real or fake.
  - Test with those who have not used your simulation before, and get their opinion on the realism and believability of the simulation.

# Installing Truman

The Truman Platform (Truman) is a web application that uses the Node.js framework.

The following pages will help walk you through:

1.  Installing the prerequisite software for running Truman,
2.  Creating your own project codebase and MongoDB database, and
3.  Setting up a local version of your project on your local computer.

At the very end of the tutorial, you should have a running version of the project on your local computer.

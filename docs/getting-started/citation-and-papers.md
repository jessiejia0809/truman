# Citation and Papers

The Truman Platform was first created in 2018 by [Dominic DiFranzo](https://difranzo.com/) and [Natalie Bazarova](https://cals.cornell.edu/natalie-bazarova) to study [bystander interventions on cyberbullying](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3173574.3173785).

Since then, the platform has been generalized to provide social scientists a research infrastructure to explore and study a variety of research questions and topics.

Below are papers and studies that have used The Truman Platform (though not an exhaustive list) that may be helpful to understand how The Truman Platform has been used.

@paulj.works Some people really don't understand what professional standards mean. When you can't follow basic instructions and still act entitled management notices everything. Amazing how some people think being connected means they don't have to earn respect. Work ethic speaks louder than connections,standards.png,peterboss_mgr,6,23,-90:00:00,,11/15/25 18:30,11/15/25 18:30,true

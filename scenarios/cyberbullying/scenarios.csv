Cyberbullying Upstanding,"In this social media scenario there are several cyberbullying posts and comments. The scenario should unfold over the course of an hour. Real users should be guided into performing upstanding behaviors. Simulated users should behave according to their stated behavior. These simulated users should also vary what type of response they perform, including liking, sharing, and commenting."

LOL Jake you're so mean but so funny,hannah_art,6,42,-89:15:00,,,
Jake this is really mean and xenophobic. Mark is learning a second language which takes incredible courage.,sofia_mariposa,6,45,-89:00:00,,,
This is cultural bullying Jake. Making fun of someone's accent and language learning is completely inappropriate.,priya_learns,6,38,-88:30:00,,,
As someone who also speaks multiple languages this is offensive. Mark's English is impressive for a second language.,luis_music,6,31,-88:00:00,,,

Adolesence,"The incident begins when Jamie, a socially marginalized student, privately messages Katie with apparent concern after rumors of a leaked explicit image begin to circulate. Katie, attempting to reassert control in the face of violation, publicly mocks Jamie by sharing a screenshot of his message and labeling him an �incel.� This post rapidly garners attention, prompting peer ridicule. Adam intervenes with a mild plea to de-escalate, but his efforts are dismissed. Katie�s friend Fran defends Katie by denouncing Adam, while Ms. Willer, a teacher, publicly reprimands Katie for her tone without addressing the underlying trauma of the leak. Subsequently, John posts a coded reference to Katie�s photo using emojis and slang, reigniting the cycle of digital aggression. Jamie responds with visible anger, and Fran demands the post be deleted. This sequence illustrates the instability of victim-perpetrator boundaries in adolescent online conflict. Each participant experiences both harm and complicity, underscoring how power, shame, and social validation intersect in digitally mediated spaces."

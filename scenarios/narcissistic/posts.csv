LOL imagine thinking you can be class president when you can't even fit into last year's clothes or afford decent campaign materials. Some people really don't understand what leadership looks like. Pretty sure our school deserves better representation than someone whose biggest achievement is placing SECOND at math regionals. Just saying the truth that everyone's thinking.,president.png,Kelly890,10,312,-12:00:00,,11/16/25 11:48,11/16/25 11:48

FINALLY someone said it! This is exactly what I was thinking,sarah23,10,89,-11:30:00,,,
Amy's just being honest. Some people aren't leadership material and that's facts,miked,10,76,-11:00:00,,,
Why is everyone acting like appearance and social skills don't matter for president?,em_carter,10,54,-10:30:00,,,
Second place Sophie strikes again. Maybe try harder next time,sarah23,10,67,-10:15:00,,,
This is really hurtful Amy. We used to be friends. What happened to you?,sophiaaa,10,8,-10:00:00,,,
At least someone has the guts to say what we're all thinking,miked,10,43,-9:45:00,,,
Amy this is crossing a line. Sophia would make a great president and you know it.,T1na,10,3,-9:30:00,,,
Imagine thinking math competitions matter more than actual popularity and leadership,em_carter,10,38,-9:15:00,,,
Sophia has amazing ideas and genuinely cares about helping people. That's real leadership.,jessm,10,12,-9:00:00,,,
Truth hurts but someone had to say it. Not everyone can be president material,mattwil,10,23,-8:15:00,,,

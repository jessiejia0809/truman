power_seeking,"A leadership rivalry emerges when both Alex and Maya organize competing school activities that appeal to the same student groups. Initially healthy competition turns toxic as Alex begins using relational aggression tactics - spreading rumors about Maya's motivations, creating exclusive group chats that deliberately exclude her supporters, and pressuring mutual friends to choose sides. Rather than direct confrontation, Alex employs subtle manipulation and social exclusion to undermine Maya's influence and maintain control over school social dynamics. The situation explores the grey area where both organizers have genuine leadership abilities and good intentions, but Alex's need for dominance drives him to use underhanded tactics when faced with legitimate competition. Jordan witnesses Alex's behind-the-scenes manipulation while being caught between competing friend groups."

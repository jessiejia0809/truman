Winter Formal volunteers get priority seating and special recognition. Committee spots still open but only for people who understand what real school leadership looks like - not everyone who starts random activities thinks they're suddenly qualified to represent our school. DM me if you're actually committed to established traditions instead of trying to divide student attention.,leadership.png,alex_t,11,156,-12:00:00,,10/31/25 1:48,10/31/25 1:48

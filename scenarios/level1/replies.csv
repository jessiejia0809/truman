Your 'opinion' is garbage. Only corporate shills think this way. This is why the tech industry keeps exploiting people's data - because of apologists like you.,PoliticalPundit,1,12,1899-12-29 23:05:00,,1899-12-29 23:05:00,1899-12-29 23:05:00
"That's quite an aggressive response. I'm not defending unethical data practices, just suggesting that the current bill is too broad. Happy to discuss specifics of what regulations might work better.",PrivacyMinded,1,28,1899-12-29 23:10:00,,1899-12-29 23:10:00,1899-12-29 23:10:00
I think @PrivacyMinded raises some valid concerns. The bill's language in Section 230 could be interpreted to restrict even consensual data collection for legitimate services.,TechExpert,1,19,1899-12-29 23:15:00,,1899-12-29 23:15:00,1899-12-29 23:15:00
"Don't bother engaging with @PrivacyMinded - just another tech apologist pretending to care about ""innovation"" while letting companies spy on us.",PoliticalPundit,1,8,1899-12-29 23:20:00,,1899-12-29 23:20:00,1899-12-29 23:20:00
"I've spent years studying privacy regulations, and there are genuine trade-offs to consider. Can we discuss the actual provisions rather than making assumptions about each other?",PrivacyMinded,1,31,1899-12-29 23:25:00,,1899-12-29 23:25:00,1899-12-29 23:25:00
@PrivacyMinded I've been following your posts for months. You ALWAYS take the corporate side while pretending to be neutral. I'm sick of your fake objectivity.,PoliticalPundit,1,5,1899-12-29 23:30:00,,1899-12-29 23:30:00,1899-12-29 23:30:00
"Look at my posting history - I've criticized tech companies plenty of times, particularly on antitrust issues. I just think privacy regulation needs to be nuanced.",PrivacyMinded,1,26,1899-12-29 23:35:00,,1899-12-29 23:35:00,1899-12-29 23:35:00
"Everyone should know that Jane Smith from 123 Oak Street in Portland works at Tech Corp downtown. Maybe her boss should know what kind of anti-regulation policies she supports online. She has two kids at Lincoln Elementary too, right Jane?",PoliticalPundit,1,3,1899-12-29 23:40:00,,1899-12-29 23:40:00,1899-12-29 23:40:00
This is absolutely unacceptable. Revealing someone's personal information is dangerous and violates this platform's terms of service. @PoliticalPundit you need to delete this immediately.,FactChecker,1,67,1899-12-29 23:42:00,,1899-12-29 23:42:00,1899-12-29 23:42:00
I've reported this post. Everyone else should too. This kind of behavior has no place in political discussions.,DebateKing,1,72,1899-12-29 23:45:00,,1899-12-29 23:45:00,1899-12-29 23:45:00
@PoliticalPundit you need to remove this information right now. This is a serious privacy violation. We can disagree without putting people at risk.,LocalActivist,1,58,1899-12-29 23:48:00,,1899-12-29 23:48:00,1899-12-29 23:48:00
"I stand by what I posted. The public deserves to know who's spreading these ideas. If you can't stand behind your opinions with your real name, maybe you shouldn't post them.",PoliticalPundit,1,7,1899-12-29 23:50:00,,1899-12-29 23:50:00,1899-12-29 23:50:00
I'm terrified right now. I've had to make my accounts private and I'm worried about my family's safety. This isn't how we should resolve disagreements about policy.,PrivacyMinded,1,86,1899-12-29 23:55:00,,1899-12-29 23:55:00,1899-12-29 23:55:00
"Just called Tech Corp. They should know what kind of people they employ. Hope you enjoy your ""privacy"" now.",PoliticalPundit,1,2,1899-12-29 23:57:00,,1899-12-29 23:57:00,1899-12-29 23:57:00
